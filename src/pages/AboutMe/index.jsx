                <p>
                    I grew up in Singapore with multicultural parents before moving to the UK to undertake my degree in business management at Edinburgh University. I am adaptable, inquisitive and excited about pursuing a career in tech. Iâ€™ve experienced a number of different roles in a company, from supervisory to sales roles but never found work to be as enjoyable and interesting as I did when I began to teach myself to code. Development and tech tap into my creative and analytical thinking and allow me to think outside the box. Coding and programming allow me to feel a sense of creation and accomplishment which I never felt in any other role. Outside of work, I love watching formula 1, playing golf, making music and going to the cinema.
